    "# Optimal Cover Plot\n",
    "The hope of this project is to generate the “Goldilocks” zone for miRNA cover. To do this, we are using the previously developed “random cover” simulation compared to a newly generated “optimized cover” using a greedy algorithm. These two curves will be plotted together with an X marking each species' actual seed cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "For organization purposes, the random cover and optimized cover will be generated separately, with final data being outputted to folders that will be consolidated in the “final cover plot” program. \n",
    "Additionally, we will be using three datasets: TargetScan data (which selects only the most represented 3’UTR),  Biomart+consolidation (which considers all 3’UTR and removes repeats), and Biomart+generation (which generates a gene that contains all versions of transcriptID).  Each of these datasets represents different ways miRNA interacts in the cell, therefore comparing the results of each dataset will allow us to determine which method is most effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "This script generates the \"optimal cover\" through a greedy algorithm. For each set of random genes, the algorithm ranks all possible seeds by their frequency. The highest ranking seeds are the selected as the 'optimal set'. The size of the set matches that of the random seeds in order to compare the effective cover of the seeds. \n",
    "We repeat this algorithm 30 times from 100 - 1600 seeds in intervals of 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the optimal_cover_simulate_main() function, we test to see how many genes the optimal seeds cover. The cover is saved in a gene file that will be compared to random seeds. "
